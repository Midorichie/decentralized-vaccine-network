# Decentralized Vaccine Development Network

## Overview
A Clarity smart contract for secure, decentralized sharing of parasite genome research data on the Stacks blockchain.

## Project Purpose
Accelerate vaccine and drug development by enabling researchers to securely share and manage parasite genome information.

## Features
- Secure genome data submission
- Granular access permission management
- Immutable research data storage
- Researcher-controlled data access

## Prerequisites
- Clarinet
- Stacks development environment
- Git

## Installation
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd decentralized-vaccine-network
clarinet check
clarinet console
```

## Smart Contract Functions
- `submit-genome-data`: Add new genome research
- `get-genome-submission`: Retrieve specific genome data
- `update-access-permissions`: Modify data access rights
- `remove-genome-submission`: Delete submission

## Security Considerations
- Owner-controlled submissions
- Data immutability
- Access permission controls

## Testing
Run comprehensive tests:
```bash
clarinet test
```

## Deployment
Prepare network-specific configurations before deploying to Stacks mainnet or testnet.
